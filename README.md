# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network in Python using only NumPy. It is trained on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) and can also predict digit classes from custom 28×28 images.

## Overview

- **Goal:** Classify handwritten digits (0–9) using a simple neural network built from scratch.
- **Dataset:** MNIST (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images).
- **Additional Testing:** Custom 28×28 JPEG images of digits stored in the `image/` directory.

The neural network has a single hidden layer (default: 64 neurons) and uses ReLU activation. It is trained using cross-entropy loss and mini-batch gradient descent.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd NEURAL_NETWORK
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

    *(Add any additional dependencies if your code requires them—e.g., `Pillow` for image processing.)*

---

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model

1. **Ensure MNIST data is in the `data/` directory** (e.g., `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv`).
2. **Run the training script**:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

    This will:
    - Load the training data.
    - Initialize and train the neural network.
    - Evaluate the network on the MNIST test set.
    - Save the trained model to `model/nn_mnist_model.pkl`.
    - Plot the training and validation loss.

### 2. Testing on MNIST Test Set

- After training, the final accuracy on the MNIST test set will be printed in the console.  
- The script in `train.py` automatically evaluates on `mnist_test.csv` and shows the accuracy.

### 3. Testing with Custom Images

To test the model on your own 28×28 digit images (stored in the `image/` directory):

1. **Place your 28×28 JPEG images** in `image/`.  
2. **Run the testing script**:

    ```bash
    python testing.py
    ```

3. **What `testing.py` does**:
    - Loads the trained model (`nn_mnist_model.pkl`).
    - Reads each image in `image/`, converts it to a NumPy array (28×28).
    - Flattens and normalizes the image data (same way as MNIST).
    - Feeds the array into the trained model to predict the digit class.
    - Prints out the predicted digit for each image.

*(You can adapt `testing.py` to display the image and its predicted label if you’d like.)*

## How It Works

### Network Architecture

1. **Input Layer (784 units):**  
    Each 28×28 pixel image is flattened into a 784-dimensional vector.
2. **Hidden Layer (64 units, configurable):**  
    Uses ReLU activation.
3. **Output Layer (10 units):**  
    One neuron per digit class (0–9), using a softmax activation to get probabilities.

### Forward Propagation

1. **Matrix Multiplication:** \( Z = W \times X + b \)
2. **Activation (Hidden Layer):** \( A = \text{ReLU}(Z) \)
3. **Output (Softmax Layer):** Probabilities over the 10 classes.

### Backpropagation

1. **Compute Loss:** We typically use cross-entropy loss for classification.
2. **Gradient Calculation:** Compute partial derivatives w.r.t. each parameter using the chain rule.
3. **Error Propagation:** Push gradients backward through the network to update weights and biases.

### Parameter Updates

- **Gradient Descent:** Update parameters by subtracting \( \alpha \times \text{gradient} \), where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
- **Update Function:** Implemented in `core/update.py`.
